## Vscode With NextJS

This project is a recreation of the user interface (UI) of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered applications. The goal of this project was to replicate the familiar and intuitive UI of VSCode and make it accessible through a web-based platform.
